\chapter{Approximating Friction of a BLDC Motor}
\label{chp5}

Friction is an important characteristic that must be considered in control theory, as it effects precise control of electro-mechanical systems, and as a result, needs inclusion in the mathematical analysis. In motor applications, there are various types of friction that come into play, such as: static, viscous, Stribeck, and Coulombic friction. However, for the sake of model simplicity, Stribeck and Coulombic friction are ignored, with focus geared towards static and viscous friction. A fit will be made between these two types of friction forces which will help develop an overall friction coefficient ($b$) to be used in mathematical formulations and control analysis. Results from this chapter will then be compared against the Motorlab. Sections \ref{electrical_dynamics} and \ref{mechanical_dynamics} will cover the model development that will be used in subsequent subsections.
